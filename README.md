REPORT:
P FILE:
Following are the basics how code is runs:
•	Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries for building a recommendation system using PySpark, MongoDB, and Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah).
•	Connecting to MongoDB: It establishes a connection to a MongoDB instance running locally on port 27017 and retrieves data from a database named 'music_database' and a collection named 'audio_features'.
•	Preparing the Data: The data obtained from MongoDB is converted into a DataFrame, which is a tabular representation commonly used in Spark. This DataFrame contains columns like 'id', 'file_name', 'file_path', and 'mfcc'. The 'mfcc' column contains arrays representing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for audio files.
•	Flattening MFCC Arrays: The MFCC arrays are flattened into a single feature vector using a VectorAssembler, which is required for training a machine learning model in PySpark.
•	Training a Recommendation Model: An Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model is instantiated with certain hyperparameters like 'maxIter' (maximum number of iterations), 'regParam' (regularization parameter), 'userCol', 'itemCol', and 'ratingCol'. Here, 'features' column is used as the rating column. The model is then trained on the DataFrame.
•	Building an ANN Index for Item Similarity: An AnnoyIndex is created to efficiently find similar items based on their embeddings. The item embeddings are extracted from the trained ALS model and added to the Annoy index.
•	Finding Similar Items Using ANN: A function find_similar_items is defined to find similar items given an item ID. It queries the Annoy index to retrieve the nearest neighbors of the specified item.
•	Hyperparameter Tuning Using Cross-Validation: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using cross-validation to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the ALS model. Different values for 'rank', 'maxIter', and 'regParam' are tried using a grid search approach.
•	Fitting ALS Model to the DataFrame: The ALS model is fit to the DataFrame using the CrossValidator instance.
•	Getting the Best ALS Model: The best ALS model obtained from cross-validation is retrieved, and its best parameters are printed.
•	Stopping Spark Session: Finally, the Spark session is stopped to release the resources.
Overall, this code demonstrates the process of building a music recommendation system using PySpark, MongoDB for data storage, and Annoy for efficient similarity search. It covers data retrieval, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation aspects.

This C++ code implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure and provides functionalities to insert, search, and delete words from the tree. Let's break down the code step by step:
	Including Libraries: The code includes necessary C++ standard libraries such as iostream, fstream, sstream, and string.
	Node Structure: A structure named Node is defined to represent a node in the BST. Each node contains a string data field (data) and pointers to its left and right children (left and right).
	Functions for BST Operations:
•	createNode: This function creates a new node with the given data.
•	insert: This function inserts a word into the BST while maintaining the BST property (left child < parent < right child).
•	find: This function searches for a word in the BST recursively.
•	findMin: This function finds the node with the minimum value in the subtree rooted at the given node.
•	deleteNode: This function deletes a word from the BST while maintaining the BST property. It handles cases where the node to be deleted has zero, one, or two children.
•	displayInOrder: This function displays the BST in alphabetical order using an in-order traversal.
	Main Function:
•	The main function starts by opening a file named "words.txt" containing a list of words to be inserted into the BST.
•	It reads each word from the file and inserts it into the BST using the insert function.
•	After populating the BST, it displays the tree in alphabetical order using the displayInOrder function.
•	It then searches for a specific word ("apple") in the BST using the find function and prints whether the word is found or not.
•	Next, it deletes a specific word ("banana") from the BST using the deleteNode function.
•	Finally, it displays the BST again after deletion to show the updated tree structure.
	File Handling: The code handles file input/output operations to read words from a text file and report errors if the file cannot be opened.
	Memory Management: Although not explicitly shown, the code should ideally include memory deallocation to free up memory occupied by the BST nodes. However, since the program is about to end (returning 0 from the main function), memory deallocation is not crucial for this specific case.
APP FILE:

This Python Flask application serves as a music recommendation and segmentation system. Let's break down the code:
	Imports: The code imports necessary libraries including Flask for web serving, os for file operations, platform for system-specific configurations, librosa for audio processing, numpy and pandas for data manipulation, annoy for approximate nearest neighbor search, and sklearn for KMeans clustering.
	Flask Setup: An instance of Flask is created, specifying the template and static folder paths.
	Configuration: The upload folder path is set based on the operating system to handle file uploads.
	Functions:
•	load_annoy_index(): Loads an Annoy index containing audio features.
•	load_features(): Loads audio features from a pickled DataFrame.
•	extract_features(): Extracts MFCC features from an audio file.
•	get_nearest_neighbours(): Finds nearest neighbors of a new audio file in the Annoy index.
•	compare_vectors(): Compares feature vectors between a new audio file and its neighbors.
•	get_best_match(): Finds the best matching song for a new audio file based on nearest neighbors and cosine distances.
•	get_worst_match(): Finds the worst matching song for a new audio file based on nearest neighbors and cosine distances.
•	audio_segmentation(): Performs audio segmentation by clustering the nearest neighbors of a new audio file using KMeans.
	Route Definitions:
•	/favicon.ico: Route for serving favicon.
•	/: Route for the home page, renders the index.html template.
•	/predict: Route for predicting the best and worst matching songs for a new audio file. It handles file upload, computes recommendations, and renders the predict.html template with the results.
	Main Execution:
•	Loads the Annoy index and audio features.
•	Defines routes and runs the Flask application in debug mode.
	Template Rendering: The HTML templates (index.html and predict.html) are rendered to display content to the user, such as file upload forms and recommendation results.
NUMERIC MONGO:
This Python script performs several tasks related to audio processing, MongoDB interaction, and approximate nearest neighbor search using the Annoy library. Let's break down the code step by step:
	Importing Libraries: The script imports necessary libraries including librosa for audio processing, pymongo for MongoDB interaction, numpy for numerical operations, os for file operations, and AnnoyIndex from the Annoy library for approximate nearest neighbor search.
	Setting Root Directory: The variable root_directory is set to the path containing subdirectories with audio files. This indicates where the audio files are located on the filesystem.
	Connecting to MongoDB: A connection is established to a MongoDB database named 'audio_db' running on the local machine on port 27017. The 'audio_features' collection within this database will be used to store and retrieve audio features.
	Creating Annoy Index: An Annoy index is created with the same number of features as the MFCC array. The number of features is determined by querying the first document in the MongoDB collection and accessing its 'mfcc' field.
	Iterating Through MongoDB Documents: The script iterates through each document in the 'audio_features' collection and adds its MFCC features to the Annoy index. Each document corresponds to an audio file and contains its associated MFCC features.
	Building Annoy Index: Once all MFCC features are added to the Annoy index, it is built with 10 trees. Building the index involves creating a data structure that allows for efficient nearest neighbor search.
	Defining Nearest Neighbor Query Function: A function named find_nearest_neighbors() is defined to query the Annoy index for the k nearest neighbors of a given audio file. This function takes the file name of the audio file as input and returns a list of tuples containing the file names of the nearest neighbors and their distances from the query audio file.
	Example Query: An example query is performed to find the 5 nearest neighbors for a given audio file named 'example.mp3'. The find_nearest_neighbors() function is called with the file name as input, and the results are printed.
	Closing MongoDB Connection: Finally, the MongoDB client connection is closed to release the resources.
